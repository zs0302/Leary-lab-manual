# Introduction
Welcome to the Leary – Ortho Biostats Lab manual. This manual was inspired by other similar works, and borrows heavily from them (e.g., [this one](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual) and [this one](https://github.com/memobc/memolab-manual)). It is intended to represent my vision for how the lab should function and to complement existing University of Missouri policies ([this](https://hrs.missouri.edu/policies-and-procedures) and [this](https://accountability.missouri.edu/accountability/university-policies/), which take precedence). We hope you will learn a lot about clinical statistics, developing new skills (coding, analyzing data, writing and giving talks), making new friends and having a great deal of fun throughout the whole process.

This work is licensed under a CC Attribution 4.0 license. We expect that more information will be added and some sections will be revised as the lab grows and develops. If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the contents of this manual, please tell Dr. Leary (learye@health.missouri.edu).


# Lab member expectations and responsibilities
## Everyone
### Big picture
- Do work that you are proud of. 
- Don’t rush your work. Double-check your work and ask others to look at your code or data if you need help or something looks off. 
- Tell your collaborators if you do make a mistake (if they have already seen the results). We admit our mistakes, and then we correct them and move on.
- Ask if you don’t know the answer or are unsure.  Do not waste time doing something that will need to be re-done later.  Make sure you understand what is needed.  Time is valuable and it is not helpful to waste it.
- No academic misconduct. It is never ok to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way.
- Be supportive of your lab mates. Share your knowledge and help them out if they need help.
- Work independently when you can, ask for help when you need it.
- Respect each other’s strengths, weaknesses, differences and beliefs.
- Take personal time/ vacation when you need it and cultivate a life outside of the lab. Respect that other lab members also have a life outside of lab.
- Communicate openly and respectfully with other members of the lab. Dr. Leary would rather know more than she needs to know than less. 
- If there is any tension or hostility in the lab, something has to be done about it immediately. If you don’t feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell Dr. Leary.

### Small picture
- Do not come into the lab if you are sick. Stay home and get healthy, and don't risk getting others sick.
- If you are an hourly employee or volunteer, notify Dr. Leary if you will be out, either due to illness or vacation. If you are salaried, you need to send an email to : MU SOM Orthopaedics Absence Request (musomabsencerequest2@missouri.edu) and cc Dr. Leary and Stacee Baker (clawsons@health.missouri.edu). If you are sick and you had experiments or meetings scheduled that day, notify your participants or collaborators and reschedule.
- You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night. You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it).
- Show up to your meetings, classes, and exams – just show up for your commitments, and work the hours you need to work to get stuff done.
- Lock the doors if no one else is around, even if you're stepping out for a minute.
- Keep your area tidy. Eating at your desk is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered.
- MOI has a specific dress code, you can check the details at [MOI dress code](#moi-dress-code). 
- Two trainings (HCUP and IRB) are necessary to be completed before working in the lab. Find details [here](#training).
- You also need to sign the [Ortho OneNote Policy](https://github.com/zhengyes/lab-manual/blob/master/Files/Ortho%20OneNote%20Policy.pdf) and [DOS National Database Policy](https://github.com/zhengyes/lab-manual/blob/master/Files/DOS%20National%20Database%20Policy.pdf) for the MOI and lab.
- Be on time. Be on time for your meetings: respect that others have packed days and everyone’s time is valuable.

## Dr. Leary Principal Investigator
All of the [Lab member expectations and responsibilities](#everyone), plus you can expect Dr. Leary to:
- Maintain a vision of where the lab is going
- Provide the funding necessary to keep the lab going
- Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to discuss your research (and anything else you’d like to discuss)
- Give you my perspective on academia and issues related to professional development
- Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, writing recommendation letters for you, providing you with opportunities to attend conferences when possible, and promoting your work in talks
- Care about you as a person and not just a scientist

## Postdocs
All of the [Lab member expectations and responsibilities](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Develop your own independent line of research
- Mentor undergraduate and graduate students on their research projects, when asked or when appropriate
- Apply for external funding.
- Apply for jobs (academic or industry) as soon as you are "ready" and/or by the end of beginning of your second year as a postdoc.
- If you are planning to pursue a non-academic career, treat your postdoctoral research as seriously as you might if you were pursuing an academic career. We can discuss ways of making sure that you are getting the training you need, while still doing excellent research.
- Remind the PI that different scientific opinions can co-exist in the same lab!

## OPT trainees & Graduate students (Master/PhD)
All of the [Lab member expectations and responsibilities](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- (PhD) Develop a line of dissertation research. Ideally, your dissertation research will consist of at least 3 experiments that can be packaged into one thesis document.
- (Master) Plan your master project with advisor and ideally, this can be submitted as at least one paper for peer-reviewed publication.
- Apply for external funding. If nothing else, this is an extremely valuable experience.
- Do some soul-searching as to what type of career you want to pursue, e.g., academic jobs that are research-focused or teaching-focused, non-academic jobs like data science or science writing. We can brainstorm ways of making sure you are getting the training that you need. Your dissertation/thesis research can support and strengthen your career goals, even if not academic.
- Work with a team of undergraduate students or graduate students more junior than you. This will speed up data collection and give you some experience with managing and mentoring a team.
- Stay up-to-date (and keep up-to-date) on any deadlines that you need to meet to fulfill departmental requirements. This is your responsibility not the PI’s.

## Lab managers
All of the [Lab member expectations and responsibilities](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Maintain and monitor the lab IRB protocols and paperwork (e.g., archiving consent forms).
- Oversee the hiring, scheduling, and training of undergraduate and master graduate level research assistants.
- Maintain the lab manual.
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Maintain databases and grant data requests.
- Help to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab.
- Work on your own research project.

## Medical Students/Residents/Fellows
All of the [Lab member expectations and responsibilities](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Work to learn basic analyses related to your projects.  You likely won’t be required to do the statistics yourself, but you should have an understanding of the statistics, the process, and why it was used.  Be knowledgeable about every aspect of your project. 
- Work on manuscripts related to projects and help others with manuscript writing, if needed.  Other lab personnel can learn a lot from your perspective and training. Let’s share knowledge. 


## Other full-time staff
All of the [Lab member expectations and responsibilities](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Work on your own research project.
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Help to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab.
- Provide extra support to the lab manager and PI.

## Undergraduate students/High School Students
All of the [Lab member expectations and responsibilities](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Work with the lab manager and/or your research mentor to determine your weekly schedule. If you are not able to come in during your normal scheduled time, you must let the lab manager or research mentor know.
- Provide extra support to the lab manager (this may include filing paperwork). If you are in lab and do not have a task to do, you should ask the lab manager or your supervisor whether there is anything you can help out with. You should not be idle.

Undergraduate research assistants play an important role in our lab, and we have a few opportunities for them to earn money or credit for their contributions. Because these opportunities require a certain degree of commitment from both the student and the lab, we generally reserve them for students who have already spent at least one semester volunteering in lab. If this policy would prevent you from being able to work in lab, please talk to Dr. Leary or the lab manager because we want all students to be able to pursue their research interests. In addition to volunteering in lab, other research opportunities include data collection.


# Code of conduct
## General
Many topics were covered already in the [Lab member expectations & responsibilities section](#lab-member-expectations-and-responsibilities).

## COVID-19 Policy
Many meetings will be moved online (see [Meetings](#meetings)) but any in-person meetings need to follow COVID-19 policies. When meeting, please wear a mask and stay home if you are experiencing any flu-like symptoms. Contact Dr. Leary, your healthcare provider, and get proper treatment. Sanitize all equipment after use and remain courteous of personal space.

## Confidentiality Policy
We expect all the lab members to exercise reasonable care in the disclosure, use and management of restricted information about patients, patient care, personnel, students and the fiscal affairs of University of Missouri Health. 

Protected Health Information (PHI) is confidential. This includes all patient information, whether in electronic, audio, photo, video or paper form. We expect all lab members to protect and preserve this confidentiality. 

MU Health operates under the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. The HIPAA Security Rules require MU Health and our business associates to use administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information (PHI). 

We do not access, obtain, disclose or discuss PHI without written authorization from patients or their legal representatives, unless necessary for treatment, payment or health care operations, or required by law. We also follow the “Minimum Necessary Rule” which means employees, faculty and staff have the right to access only the patient information necessary to perform our respective jobs. If you have questions regarding access to PHI, please contact Dr. Leary first. The System Privacy Office is available at (573) 882-3293.

### HIPAA 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which became law in 1996, was intended to improve health insurance information portability and to simplify the administration of health care information.  The Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA dictated that national standards for electronic health care transactions and code sets; and national identifiers for providers, health plans, and employers were established which were intended to ensure security and privacy of health information.  This resulted in the improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system through the establishment of standards for electronic data interchange. 

The HIPAA Privacy Rule protects all "individually identifiable health information" held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral. The Privacy Rule calls this information "protected health information (PHI)."

“Individually identifiable health information” is information, including demographic data, that relates to:

* the individual’s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition,
* the provision of health care to the individual, or
* the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual,
and that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual. Individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, zipcode, Social Security Number). 

Dr. Leary will generally send you the data without identifiable health information. All work, and particularly data, should be stored on OneDrive or the OrthoStats folder on the H drive as it is compliant with DSL 4, HIPAA, and HITECH guidelines. OneDrive accounts must be configured to comply with HIPAA requirements. Any identifiable data posted on the lab OneNote should be password protected. Any identifiable data cannot be viewed or studied unless you are listed as study personnel on that studys' IRB.

## Data Security
We must exercise reasonable care in the disclosure, transmission, access, use and management of confidential information about patients, patient care, personnel, students and proprietary business affairs of University of Missouri Health. 
As stated in the University of Missouri Acceptable Use Policy, electronic information on MU Health networks or equipment, including, but not limited to, electronic mail and personal information, is subject to examination when: 

* It is necessary to maintain or improve the functioning of our computing resources. 
* There is suspicion of misconduct under MU Health policies or suspicion of violation of federal or state law. 
* It is necessary to comply with or verify compliance with federal or state law. 


Protecting confidential information is a priority within our health care system: 

*	Do NOT access patient information unless you need the information to do your job. Inappropriate access to patient information will lead to disciplinary action and possible dismissal from the lab. 
*	You are to access only the minimum information necessary to accomplish your assigned job duties. This includes all information in paper and electronic form. 
*	Only discuss patient information with authorized personnel and in a private location where unauthorized persons cannot overhear even if you are not using patient names. 
*	Do NOT give information about patients or staff to anyone over the phone.
*	Shred or place confidential information in receptacles specifically used for confidential waste disposal. Never put confidential waste in recycle bins or the regular trash. 
*	[The Access and Confidentiality Agreement](https://www.umsystem.edu/media/is/infosec/confidentiality-agreement.pdf) must be read and signed by all instructors and all lab members. 
*   Some more information about MU health confidentiality can be found [here](https://medicine.missouri.edu/centers-institutes-labs/health-ethics/faq/confidentiality).
*	Do not email datasets, even if using encrypted email. Instead, add the recipient as a viewer to the file on OneDrive and then send the link to the intended recipient.

## Lab OneNote/project administration policy
Upon your involvement in research at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, you will be assigned a OneNote folder to aid in your work. Research or lab notes are an essential part of doing scientific research. The purpose of this OneNote is to have an organized location for you to record and store notes and protocols about the research projects you are involved in through the department. This will help you to keep track of your work and allow you and others to review the steps taken during your analyses.


### Expectations
This OneNote:
*	should contain a detailed account of the statistical analyses you perform,
*	should be organized and detailed enough for someone else to read and understand what you did,
*   should be in English.
*   should not contain notes for other courses or projects outside of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.

### Security
In order to minimize dissemination of unauthorized information, all lab members should consider the sensitivity of the information that might be contained within the OneNote when working outside the office. Due to the sensitive nature of the data that you will be working with, the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery retains the right to confiscate the data anytime during or after your involvement with any affiliated research projects. 


## Schedule Notification
For all lab members, your particular work of the previous week and work schedule for the following week will be discussed and assigned during the weekly meeting. 

The lab meeting is obligatory for each member. If you will be absent for some particular reason for the lab meeting, reasonable notification needs to be made to Dr. Leary. For students, schoolwork is priority, however you need to communicate with your supervisors when your schoolwork conflicts with Lab work and it is necessary to reduce work hours.


**In addition:**

All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody. Please also see the University of Missouri [NONDISCRIMINATION POLICY](https://www.umsystem.edu/ums/rules/collected_rules/equal_employment_educational_opportunity/ch600/600.010_equal_employment_educational_opportunity_policy).

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery are generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Dr. Leary immediately. If Dr. Leary is the cause of your concern, then please reach out to Ms. Stacee Baker, Dr. James Cook or another trusted department member who can assist.

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event or activity.

## Scientific integrity
### Reproducible research
Reproducible research is research that can be exactly reproduced given the *same* raw data. It is an *essential* part of science, and an expectation for all projects in the lab. Reproducibility is related to replicability, which refers to whether your results can be obtained again with a *different* data set. We expect that all of our research will be replicable, or at least reproducible.

For results to be reproducible, it requires that you are organized and possess sufficient foresight to document each step of your research process. There are two main things you can do to improve the reproducibility of your research:
- Extensive notetaking. You will need extensive notes on each step of your analysis pipeline, explaining how you did things every step of the way (and the order that you did things), from any pre-processing of the data, to running models, to statistical tests. Your code should also be commented clearly so that every step is understandable by an outsider. 
- Programming workflows with version control. It is highly encouraged that you use some form of version control (e.g., Git in combination with GitHub or file naming conventions for code saved to OneDrive or other storage locations) to keep track of what code changes you made and when you made them, as well as sharing code with others.

### Authorship
We will follow NIH guidelines with respect to authorship

>"Authorship credit should reflect the individual's contribution to the study. An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published."

Authorship will be discussed prior to the beginning of a new project, so that expectations are clearly defined. However, changes to authorship may occur over the course of a project if a new person becomes involved or if someone is not fulfilling their planned role. In general, graduate students and postdocs will be first authors on publications on which they are the primary lead, and Dr. Leary will be the last author.

#### Old projects
If a student or post-doc collects a dataset but does not completely analyze it or write it up within 2 years after the end of data collection, Dr. Leary will re-assign the project (if appropriate) to another person to expedite publication. If a student or post-doc voluntarily relinquishes their rights to the project prior to the 2-year window, Dr. Leary will also re-assign the project to another individual. This policy is here to prevent data (especially expensive data) from remaining unpublished but is meant to give priority to the person who initially led the project.

## Human subjects research
Adherence to approved IRB protocols is *essential*, and non-adherence can lead to severe consequences for the entire lab. **All lab members must read and comply with the IRB consent form and research summary for any project that they are working on.** If you are not on the IRB, you cannot look at identifiable data, analyze the data, or be in any way involved with the project. Check [here](#training) to see details about the training for IRB.

Lab members must also complete the CITI training and save their certificate. To be added to an existing IRB, talk to the lab manager and present them with your CITI certificate before you can work with human subjects. If there are any questions about the protocols, or if you're not sure whether we have IRB approval to run your study, please ask the lab manager or Dr. Leary for clarification. If necessary, the lab manager or Mr. Eric Zelasko (zelaskoe@health.missouri.edu) can file an amendment to an existing protocol or create a new protocol.

If you encounter any problems in the course of doing research that results in a negative outcome for the participant (e.g., if a participant becomes ill or upset, if there is an accident with the equipment, if there is a breach of confidentiality, etc), you should immediately seek assistance from Dr. Leary or the lab manager. If Dr. Leary is not around, you must notify Dr. Leary and the lab manager *within 24 hours*, preferably as soon as possible. In some cases, we may need to report this information to the IRB and/or our funding agencies.


# Lab Resources
## GitHub
GitHub is a hosting service. Projects on GitHub can be accessed and manipulated using the standard Git command-line interface and all of the standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows registered and non-registered users to browse public repositories on the site. All members must register an account in order to contribute to discussion and manage repository. This lab manual is on GitHub. Please check the [lab manual](https://github.com/LearyE/lab-manual) first,  if you have any lab related questions. 

## Outlook
Outlook is primarily an email application, it also includes a calendar, task manager, contact manager, note taking, journal, and web browsing. Using Outlook is required for the lab.

Tasks can be assigned via Outlook (email) through OneNote, so all members are expected to check emails every day and to respond to emails throughout the week (weekends excluded).

## Outlook Calendar
Outlook Calendar is within Outlook. It can help to arrange and manage meetings and events. Dr. Leary will send notifications about meeting location and time via Outlook Calendar. Please keep your Outlook Calendar connected and up to date.

## OneNote
OneNote is a digital notebook for taking notes and managing information. Notes can be shared with other OneNote users over the internet or network. Relevant notes from the lab meeting or tasks will be posted on OneNote and sent through Outlook. OneNote will be used as our project management tool, to communicate/share project progress (through tasks etc.) and using email.

## OneDrive
OneDrive is a tool that allows you to sync data stored on Microsoft Office to your desktop. It essentially allows OneDrive to function as a cloud "drive" on your computer. You can navigate and modify content stored on the OneDrive website through your computer’s native file browsing interface, without using a web browser. You must log in to your Microsoft account every time you wish to use it. To install OneDrive, please check [this](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sync-files-with-onedrive-in-windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49) if you have problem about installing or setting sync folder. Currently, OneDrive is approved for all files and applications. 

## Project Management using OrthoStats folder on H drive
Dr. Leary will assign each lab member an OneDrive folder with your name. This folder must contain all the materials of your projects. Do not save any project materials on a computer or in another cloud service. If system lags make this impossible, all material must be moved to the OrthoStats folder on the H drive each week. 


# General policies
## Hours
One of the benefits of a career in academic research is that it is typically more flexible than other kinds of jobs. However, you should still treat it like a job. If you are employed for 40 hours a week, you should be working 40 hours a week. This applies to lab staff members (the lab manager and other research assistants) and postdocs. You are not required to work over-time. For graduate students, you are recognized to have other demands on your time like classes and TA-ing but we still expect to see you in lab, doing research, often. Lab staff members are expected to keep regular office hours (e.g., somewhere in the ballpark of 8-5). Graduate students and postdocs have more flexibility. 

### Office hours
Dr. Leary is generally in her office (MOI room 4216) from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays. Due to COVID-19, she is mainly working remotely, but is still available in the given time frame. You can send her an email if you cannot find her. The lab office is room 4218 at Missouri Orthopaedic Institute.

## Meetings
### Weekly lab meetings
Weekly lab meetings will be focused on project presentations and going over new data or methods. The weekly lab meeting is currently occurring remotely (via Zoom) every Tuesday sometime in the afternoon, meetings usually last about 1 to 1.5 hours. If the location or time changes, Dr. Leary will email you in advance. If at the end of meeting, we need more time to discuss something, we will schedule another meeting. Lab meeting agendas and notes must be updated and maintained by each lab member. This is located in the `lab meetings` folder on OneNote. All lab members are expected to attend the weekly lab meeting. 

### Individual meetings

## Deadlines
It is essential to stay ahead of deadlines and keep organized. When it comes to deadlines, tell your collaborators **as soon as you know when a deadline is**, and make sure they are aware of it the closer it gets. Don’t be afraid to bug them about it.

Dr. Leary will expect advance notice of at least 2 weeks for reading/commenting on abstracts, papers, and manuscripts, 2 weeks for filling out paperwork, etc, and 2 weeks for letters of recommendation. If you want feedback on research and teaching statements, or other work that requires multiple back-and-forth interactions between you and Dr. Leary before a hard deadline, give her as much time as you can.

## Presentations/Abstracts
It is highly encouraged that you seek out opportunities to present your research, whether it is at departmental talk series and events, to other labs at conferences, or to the general public. Abstracts from work done in the lab must be approved by all authors (and Dr. Leary) prior to submission. If you are going to give a presentation (a poster or a talk), be prepared to give a practice presentation to the lab at least one week ahead of time (two weeks or more are advisable for conference presentations, and many weeks ahead of time are advisable for job talks, which require a lot of refining).  Practice talks will help you feel comfortable with your presentation, and will also allow you to get feedback from the lab and implement those changes well in advance of your real presentation.

Templates for posters are available at [here](https://github.com/zhengyes/lab-manual/blob/master/Poster_Template), and those are highly recommended, particularly for orthopaedic focused conferences. Some general rules for posters should be followed: minimize text as much as possible (if you wrote a paragraph, you’re doing it wrong), make figures and text large and easy to see at a distance, label your axes, and make sure different colors are easily discriminable. 

## Recommendation letters
Letters of recommendation are one of the many benefits of working in a research lab. You can count on Dr. Leary to write a letter if you have spent at least 6 months in the lab. (It’s hard to really know someone if they have only been around for a few months.) Exceptions can be made for shorter-term lab members in special circumstances (e.g., new graduate students or postdocs applying for fellowships). 

To request a letter of recommendation, please adhere to the deadline requirements described above, your current CV and any relevant instructions for the contents of the letter. Your specific aims or a short summary are required if you are applying for a grant. In some but not all cases, you may be asked to draft a letter, which will be revised to be consistent with evaluation. This will ensure that the letter contains all the information you need, and that it is submitted on time.

## Data management
### Storing active datasets (need to complete)
In general, data will be stored in one of four places:
- Your assigned OneDrive folder

### Data organization
The projects will have the following folders in each project folder for consistent project management (Data, Program, Output, Reports). 

*	Data – put all Data here, initial data, formatted data, data dictionaries etc. You should keep the original data in a folder labeled "Original". Put all datasets you created in an archive folder so that other members can check the data at anytime, without rerunning your code. Final version for all analyses must be exported to .csv format and have a corresponding data dictionary. Aim to be consistent with the way data is organized between documents to allow for an easier transition into R.
*	Programs – put all R code here or any other code. You must save your R code each time you revise it - please use a date in your file name (YYYYMMDD). You must annotate all of your R code. It may be years until you need to re-visit a project (or I may need to later on). Annotate your code! 
*	Output – put all calculated tables, figures, and other output here. You must save your R workspace here. Date your files using the filename.
*	Reports – put all report drafts here as well as any other reporting documents or data. Date your files in the filename.

You should use an organization scheme like the above one. When you archive the dataset, you will be required to format it like the above (or something similarly transparent in its organization), so it might as well start that way. 

### File management
You must save each file with the date in the filename using the following format, “yyyymmdd”. For example, if I were saving a report for an ACL project on Aug 10, 2017 it would be saved as “Report_ACLproject_20170810.docx”. It is extremely important that the R code file matches the R workspace file – this is why putting dates in the file names are so important. Never delete old files – they should all have different names (because of the date at the end) and be placed in an “OLD” subfolder, within each project folder. 

### Basic Data Management
All data must be checked for validity, reasonability, and formatting. Sometimes missing data are denoted by “.”, “_”, “NA”, “NaN”, “-99” or “9999”. Or sometimes values are incorrect, for example, if you have a negative weight or weigh 9999lbs. If you do not check, these can be included in calculated means and other analyses. These may need to be re-coded – this is fine as long as this is documented in the report. 

All statistical assumptions must be met prior to analysis. If assumptions are not met, investigate other approaches (e.g. non-parametric) or by combining categories for small cell counts.  It is best to discuss briefly with Dr. Leary to ensure that extra time is not wasted. 

### Archiving inactive datasets
Before you leave the lab, you will be required to document and archive all datasets that you have collected or analyzed. The dataset will be reviewed before you leave. Please move the data to your folder (OneDrive folder or Orthosstats folder), and make sure annotated codes are included and will run data (e.g. produce the final data). 

### Data sharing
Not only is data-sharing the right thing to do, we are actually required to do so for any dataset that was funded by the NIH. NIH has issued new [policy](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_guidance.htm) for data managemenr and sharing, things to note is the special formatting requirements. The final datasets must be archived in .csv format with a complete data dictionary. You should also be prepared to share any scripts or code that you used in your published processing & analysis pipeline. Dr. Leary will be responsible for sharing all final data; you are responsible for formatting and organizing your data so she can do that.

### Project management

A .txt readme file is required to be located in the project folder.

This readme file should include the information below for each time you update this project.
<p align="center">
<img src="Pictures/proj_managemt.png" width="600">
</p>

Line 1: Time (yyyy/mm/dd)

Line 2: Author

Line 3: What are the current tasks

Line 4: The work you have done

### Code annotations

It is very IMPORTANT to make sure your code can be easily read and understood. Writing the code comment properly can be beneficial for code maintaining, updating, and correcting to both you and other people who may use it in the future. We recommend the guidelines below to write precise, legible code comments.

0. Write codes in different sections by their purposes, and use a line to separate them. For example, we can have a preprocessing section and an analysis section in the code. Draw a line to determine the boundary of these two sections.

1. Section headings Each section should have a brief description about the purpose. For each chunk of code which implement a specific task, write comments to describe what it is and the purpose of it. Avoid using redundant, misleading or funny/insulting comments.

2. Naming convention Use clear variable and function names to reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code. Choose a naming style and be consistent, use camelCase or under_scores but not both. Name the variable or function by what it does. For example, if your variable stores the information of patient income as a categorical variable, you can call it Income_Levels.



# Funding

## Allocation of expenses
Dr. Leary will oversee all aspects of the financial management of lab funding sources. However, it is important to be transparent about where research money comes from and how it's spent. Dr. Leary has included some notes below but please do not hesitate to ask if you want to know more details.
* MOI/TLRO: These funds are flexible in that they can be used for any justifiable purpose.
* NIH: NIH funds are restricted to these projects only.
* DoD: Department of Defense (DoD) funds are restricted to these projects only. 
* SOM or Internal funds: these funds are restricted to these projects only.
* Other funds: Sometimes the lab receives small amounts of unrestricted funds from the
university; these can be spent in the same way as MOI/TLRO funds.

## Funding notes
All research funded by the NIH and DoD must acknowledge the grant number upon publication. This is essential for documenting that we are turning their money into research findings. We must also submit a yearly progress report describing what we have accomplished. Lab members involved in the research will be asked to contribute to the progress report.
Research funded by other grants (e.g., SOM funding) must also acknowledge the source of funding and provide a statement which whatever other funding source provides.


# Appendix

Once you have completed the IRB training, you will need to add the GCP training and follow the GCP instructions next to “IRB course instructions”. The page of IRB course instructions and GCP instructions are shown in the figure below.

When you complete these trainings, save your completion certificates as .pdf files and email to Ms. Vicki Jones (jonesvicki@health.missouri.edu) and cc Dr. Leary.

2. Data Use Agreement (DUA)

* DUA for NIS/HCUP:
    *All personnel will need to fill out and sign the data use agreement and **send it to Dr. Leary**. It is located [here](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/team/NationwideDUA.pdf).  

* DUA for NSQIP: [here](https://www.facs.org/-/media/files/quality-programs/nsqip/datauseagreementacsnsqippuf.ashx?la=en). 

3. Swirl R Coding (Optional)

4. Useful R function for data checking and generating summary statistics

[Here](https://github.com/zhengyes/Leary-lab-manual/blob/master/Summary_Statistics.R) we developed a convenient and efficient R programming code template which can generate summary tables, linear regression and logistic regression results for your data. This code was developed and shared by our lab member, Jinpu Li. This code uses ‘data file’, ‘independent variable’, ‘dependent variable’ and ‘output path’ as the function inputs.  The result is  one excel file with three sheets (tabs). 

 * The first sheet contains the summary statistics for all variables, separately for numerical and categorical variables. 
 * The second sheet contains the simple linear regression results and linear regression assumption check plots. The goodness of fit measures, R square or adjusted R square, is also reported for each model.
 * The third sheet contains the simple logistic regression result. Odds ratios for categorical variables, as well as numerical variables summary statistics and their comparison test result, are also reported by outcome group.

Here are three things you need to pay attention when using this code: 1. All categorical variables should be saved as factors. 2. The reference level should be the first level. 3. There should be no missing data. After these data are preprocessed, run the code below and an excel file will be created using the provided output path. The plot cache is deleted to free up your local storage but everything is output to the excel file.

```{r eval=FALSE}
source("your path for Summary_Statistics.R")
Summary_statistics(Input_Data = your data,
                   Independent_Vars = your independent variable list,
                   Dependent_Vars = your dependent variable list,
                   Output_Path = your output_path)
```

We created a test data [here](https://github.com/zhengyes/Leary-lab-manual/blob/master/Summary_Statistics_Test.R) with random numbers for you to have a try.


## File Formatting

*	All Word Files must be changed to the English language and all reports must be spell-checked (in English!). 
*	All tables and figures must have a title.
*	All figures must have labels for both the y-axis and the x-axis. These labels should also be formatted for presentation. 


## REDCap Instruction

We use REDCap to track hours and record what you have done weekly, it can help us to manage your work and make a long-term plan for both of you and our projects.

## Datasets available in lab

### NHIS

The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has monitored the health of the nation since 1957. NHIS data on a broad range of health topics are collected through personal household interviews. For over 50 years, the U.S. Census Bureau has been the data collection agent for the National Health Interview Survey. Survey results have been instrumental in providing data to track health status, health care access, and progress toward achieving national health objectives. Some more information can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm).

### MEPS

The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) is a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals, their medical providers, and employers across the United States. MEPS is the most complete source of data on the cost and use of health care and health insurance coverage. Some more information can be found [here](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/)

### NIS

The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) is part of the family of databases and software tools developed for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The NIS is the largest all-payer inpatient care database in the United States, containing data on more than seven million hospital stays. Its large sample size is ideal for developing national and regional estimates, and it enables analyses of rare conditions, uncommon treatments, and special populations. We paid for this dataset, please contact Dr. Leary if you need help. Some more information can be found [here](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/news/exhibit_booth/nis_brochure.jsp). 

### NSQIP


The ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP®) is a nationally validated, risk-adjusted, outcomes-based program to measure and improve the quality of surgical care. Built by surgeons for surgeons, ACS NSQIP provides participating hospitals with tools, analyses, and reports to make informed decisions about improving quality of care. Further, peer-reviewed studies have shown that ACS NSQIP is effective in improving the quality of surgical care while also reducing complications and costs. We paid for this dataset, please contact Dr. Leary if you need help. Some more information can be found [here](https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/acs-nsqip)
